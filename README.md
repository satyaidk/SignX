# Analogy:

You can think of this data preparation like a chef preparing ingredients for a large banquet. First, the chef catalogs all available ingredients (creating the DataFrame). Then, they set aside a small portion of the best ingredients to taste-test the final dish (the test set). Before cooking, they wash and chop everything into uniform sizes (normalization and resizing) and even toss them around to ensure they are well-mixed (augmentation), ensuring the final meal is consistent no-matter which part of the pot you scoop from.
